## Step 4: Clone and Configure This App

### Clone Repository
```bash

cd knowledge-assistant-template
```

### Update Configuration Files

#### 1. databricks.yml
```yaml
resources:
  serving-endpoints:
    serving-endpoint:
      name: "YOUR_AGENT_ENDPOINT_NAME"  # Replace with your endpoint name
      permissions:
        - level: CAN_QUERY
          principal: "{{workspace.current_user.userName}}"
```

#### 2. Customize app.py
Update the header and branding:
```python
# Change the title and subtitle
st.markdown("""
<div class="main-header">
    <h1 class="main-title">üè¢ Your Company Knowledge Assistant üìö</h1>
    <p class="main-subtitle">Your AI-powered expert for company policies</p>
</div>
""", unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

example_questions = [
    "What is our remote work policy?",
    "How do I request time off?",
    "What are the company benefits?",
    "Where can I find the employee handbook?"
]
```

## Step 5: Deploy to Databricks

### Sync Your Code

2. **Go to your synced folder**
3. **Deploy using Databricks Apps**
   - Right-click on the folder
   - Select **Deploy as App**
